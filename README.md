# Dune

Code in CircuitPython

> Dune is a lamp designed for massage waiting rooms. Inspired by the Japanese dry garden / zen garden, we hope to bring an experience of peace, meditation, and emptiness by praising the circular movements of shadows created through the miniature landscape lightened by dynamic LEDs to help patients breathe and relax.
